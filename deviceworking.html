						<p style="padding: 5%;">This device is helpful to the women.There are many devices but selecting the right women's safety device 
							depends on individual preferences and needs. Combining these devices with self-defense knowledge and 
							situational awareness can contribute to personal safety. Always abide by local laws and regulations when
							carrying or using these tools.Women's safety devices come in various forms, ranging from smartphone apps
							to wearable gadgets. These devices are designed to provide an added layer of security andhelp women feel 
							safer in potentially risky situations.The women should stay aware of their surroundings, avoid distractions
							like excessive smartphone use when walking alone, and trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right, 
							leave the area or seek help.Always inform someone you trust about your whereabouts and expected return time, 
							especially when going out at night or to unfamiliar places.Whenever possible, avoid walking alone, 
							especially in isolated or poorly lit areas. Keep a form of identification on you, and ensure your phone
							is charged and has emergency contacts saved. Use reputable transportation services, and consider sharing
							ride details with a friend or using a women's safety app for ride-sharing.When using a device it should be
							connected to a dedicated emergency response system or mobile application.The system should be staffed 24/7
							to respond promptly to distress signals,dispatch assistance,and coordinate with relevant authorities.
